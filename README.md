# Maze-Solving-Robot

This is a Maze Solving Robot that is based on the Left-Hand Maze Solving Algorithm. The algorithm states that if there is a left turn then the robot should turn left irrespective of any other possibilities, the next preference is given to straight path and then finally if there only when is neither a left nor strait, the robot will turn right. In case the robot reaches a dead end, it will take a U turn.

The robot uses the Arduino Uno as the Microcontroller to execute the program and control the sensors and the motors. The robot follows black line on white background.

Parts Required to build the robot:

1)	Arduino Uno
2)	2 Wheel Robot car Chassis Kit
3)	4 Infra-Red Sensors
4)	1 L293D H-Bridge motor driver shield
5)	4 AAA Batteries
6)	Wires to connect the motor and sensors to the Arduino board.
7)	Black Table to create the Maze.
